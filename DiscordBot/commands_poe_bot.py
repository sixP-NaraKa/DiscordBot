def get_price(want_currency, have_currency="Chaos Orb"):
    """ General method for searching for the price of a given Currency item in Path of Exile.

        This method is easily reusable and makes it easier to search for specific currency items.

        Once it has its items and the sum of them, it performs a median calculation, to find the "more correct" pricing
        than just the first item could bring (might be a bot/troll pricing it way lower, etc.).

        Instead of using the dict(s), you could also only take the ID's, though then you would have to memorize them.
        Then you could take the names during the parsing process.
        Also you could use the search function on the site via selenium, though this might take longer (performance).
        I think I am happy as it is. Will expand the dict with all the rest of the currency items -
        at least the basic ones soon-ish. ;)

        Uses the bs4 module for faster extracting (instead of selenium).

        :param want_currency: the name of the item to look for (just for better output) - can also be parsed from the page
        :param have_currency: the item name to compare/price against (usually ID 4, i.e. Chaos Orb)
