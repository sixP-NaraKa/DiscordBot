# ToDo:
#   - in the create-channel command add a way for the user to specify which category he wants to add the channel to
#       - if the category does not exist (or anything close to it) then create a new category) - create new method here
#   - put the plotting in the online command maybe in a seperate function, for visibility sake
#       - also make it more pleasing looking
#       - also make the online command only usable in AoE channels/categories
#   - with the new functions and adding the older ones, keep up the documentation, etc.
