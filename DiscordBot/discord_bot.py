# ToDo:
#   - also, if desired by the user, delete all the channels (if applicable) from the specific category as well
#   - put the plotting in the online command maybe in a seperate function, for visibility sake
#       - also make it more pleasing looking
#       - also make the online command only usable in AoE channels/categories
#   - with the new functions and adding the older ones, keep up the documentation, etc.
#   - ...
#   - if you want to create category or channel the name of an already existing category or channel is crucial
#       - including wanting a channel which has the same name as a category and vice versa (i.e. it doesn't work then, cause already exists)
#       - might want to note that down in the commands / error messages to the user, etc.
